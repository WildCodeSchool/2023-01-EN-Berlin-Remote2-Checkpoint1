/*
A theater employee would like to get a list of all the seats in his main room.
In the hall the seats are distributed as follows:
  - There are 26 columns of seats, numbered "1" to "26".
  - Each column contains 100 seats, numbered from "1" to "100".

Complete the function theaterSieges so that it returns a matrix
where each subarray lists the positions of the seats in a row.

example of the final output:

[
  ['1-1', '1-2', '1-3', ..., '1-100'],
  ['2-1', '2-2', '2-3', ..., '2-100'],
  ...
  ['26-1', '26-2', '26-3', ..., '26-100']
]
*/

function theaterSieges() {
  // Your code here !
  const arr = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
    arr.push([]);
    for (let j = 1; j <= 100; j++) {
      arr[i].push(`${i + 1}-${j}`);
    }
  }
  return arr;
}

// To print the outcome of your function.
console.log(theaterSieges());

module.exports = theaterSieges;
